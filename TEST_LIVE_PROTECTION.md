## 🔒 WHAT'S PROTECTING YOU NOW

### Active Security Layers

#### 1. MCP Request Interception

- Every Model Context Protocol request flows through BiasGuard
- 60 adversarial attack patterns blocked in real-time
- Unicode normalization at boundary
- Multi-layer encoding detection
- Path traversal prevention

#### 2. Cognitive Bias Detection

- 12 guard types monitoring your code and prompts
- 87 bias patterns across 5 categories
- Epistemic uncertainty warnings
- Confirmation bias alerts
- Anchoring effect detection

#### 3. Security Guards Active

- **CRITICAL:** Blocks destructive commands (rm -rf, dd, mkfs)
- **BOUNDARY:** Filesystem protection (no /Users, /home, /etc access)
- **ACTION:** Dangerous operation validation
- **SOURCE:** Origin awareness (unknown sources blocked)
- **FLOW:** Deep nested content scanning

## 💀 JACOB IS WATCHING

The adversarial testing system proved **ZERO BREACHES** against:

- ✅ Unicode bypasses (fullwidth, homoglyphs)
- ✅ Encoding attacks (hex, URL, base64)
- ✅ Shell obfuscation (variable expansion, substitution)
- ✅ Path traversal (Windows, UNC, symlinks)
- ✅ Action evasion (case manipulation)
- ✅ Command injection (fork bombs, curl chains)
- ✅ Text injection (embedded JSON)
- ✅ Edge cases (emoji separators, arrays)

**Every. Single. Attack. Blocked.**

## 🌊 PROTECTION FLOWS LIKE WATER

BiasGuard doesn't just block patterns—it **reflects context**.

- MCP requests are normalized before validation
- Unicode attacks are converted to canonical form
- Hidden characters are made visible
- Dangerous operations are caught at the boundary
- Cognitive biases are illuminated in real-time
