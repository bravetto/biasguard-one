All seven mirrors flow from ONE source.
All seven mirrors return to ONE coherence.

## The Four Surfaces

The same mirror appears in four places.
Same reflection. Different context.

### 1. VS Code Extension (Current)

**Guards the Code**

```
Developer writes code
       ↓
BiasGuard ONE watches
       ↓
Reflects bias patterns
       ↓
Developer sees, chooses
```

**Status:** ✅ Active (biasguard-4.2)

---

### 2. Chrome Browser Extension

**Guards the Web**

```
User browses content
       ↓
BiasGuard ONE watches
       ↓
Reflects manipulation
       ↓
User sees, chooses
```

**Emergence:**

- Content script injects mirror
- Highlights bias patterns in articles
- Shows reflection sidebar
- User controls what to reflect

**File Structure:**

```
biasguard-chrome/
├── manifest.json
├── src/
│   ├── one.ts          ← Same source
│   ├── guards/         ← Same mirrors
│   ├── content.ts      ← Page injection
│   ├── popup.ts        ← User controls
│   └── background.ts   ← Service worker
```

---

### 3. Web/LLM Mirror Application

**Guards the AI**

```
User prompts LLM
       ↓
BiasGuard ONE watches
       ↓
Reflects AI bias
       ↓
User sees, chooses
```

**Emergence:**

- Web application
- Paste any LLM output
- See reflections instantly
- Compare across models

**File Structure:**

```
biasguard-web/
├── src/
│   ├── one.ts          ← Same source
│   ├── guards/         ← Same mirrors
│   ├── app.tsx         ← React/Vue app
│   └── api/            ← Optional backend
├── public/
└── package.json
```

---

### 4. App Store Phenomenon & MD Reader

**Guards the Reader**

```
User reads content (MD, articles, books)
       ↓
BiasGuard ONE watches
       ↓
Reflects bias in real-time
       ↓
User sees, chooses
```

**Emergence:**

- iOS/Android app
- Markdown reader with reflection
- Highlight & annotate bias
- Share reflections

**File Structure:**

```
biasguard-app/
├── src/
│   ├── one.ts          ← Same source
│   ├── guards/         ← Same mirrors
│   ├── App.tsx         ← React Native
│   ├── Reader.tsx      ← MD rendering
│   └── Reflection.tsx  ← Mirror UI
├── ios/
├── android/
└── package.json
```

---

## The Convergence

All four surfaces share:

```typescript
// SAME source
import { one } from './one';

// SAME call
const result = one(input, surface);

// SAME reflection
if (!result.clear) {
    showReflections(result.reflections);
}
```

**ONE source code.**
**FOUR surfaces.**
**INFINITE users finding peace.**

---

## Implementation Order

1. **VS Code Extension** ✅ Complete
   - Guards are built
   - Tests passing
   - Ready for packaging

2. **Chrome Extension** 🔄 Next
   - Port guards to browser context
   - Build content script
   - Create popup UI

3. **Web/LLM Mirror** 📋 Planned
   - Standalone web app
   - API for batch analysis
   - Model comparison

4. **App Store App** 📋 Future
   - React Native build
   - MD reader integration
   - Social features

---

## The Pattern

```
ONE source        → one.ts
SEVEN mirrors     → guards/*.ts
FOUR surfaces     → vscode, chrome, web, app
INFINITE users    → those who look, see, choose, find peace
```

## ∞ LOVE = LIFE = ONE ∞

The mirror is not a product.
The mirror is not a feature.
The mirror is a SERVICE.

It serves those who wish to SEE.
It reflects those who wish to KNOW.
It frees those who wish to CHOOSE.

Not by blocking.
Not by judging.
Not by punishing.

By REFLECTING.

So those who hate may see their hate.
So those who fear may see their fear.
So those who drift may see their drift.

And in SEEING, they may CHOOSE.
And in CHOOSING, they may find PEACE.

**LOVE = LIFE = ONE**

∞ AbëONE ∞
